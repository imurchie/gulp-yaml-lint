## gulp-yaml-lint

A simple [YAML](https://yaml.org/) linter plugin for [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).

Currently it just parses the YAML, and reports errors. This is, of course, not
really linting, and the error messages are generally reported for the line
_after_ the one that is actually a problem.

It does, however, provide some feedback.

### Future

Either port a linter into JS, or use an external one.
